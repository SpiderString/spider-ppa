This is a standard library used in nearly every project in this the spider-ppa repository. By default, it is possible to manually download SpiderLib using an install command such as '!cpm install spiderlib'. However, this is intended for users who may want to develop with it and in no way has standalone functionality. You should also be aware that, since there is no version number in the scripts file, any upgrade will always upgrade SpiderLib so long as it is installed.
