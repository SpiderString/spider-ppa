This is the package for the CobwebPackageManager. If this is your first time installing it or it is a fresh install, download the CobwebPackageManager.zip file and extract the contents(the folder named CobwebPackageManager) to .minecraft/mods/advancedMacros/macros. Do not take anything out of the folder. You should then be able to run minecraft, bind 'CobwebPackageManager/cobwebUI' to the "ChatSendFilter" event, and type '!cpm upgrade' to get the latest version. 

The current version of the zip is 0.5, and the Advanced Macros version it supports is 5.8.1. A new version will be posted alongside CPM 0.5 for AM 6 once it has been developed to accomodate the changes. CPM will not run with AM 6 at the moment.

To list available packages, type '!cpm list'. Third party repositories are supported, though at current the url must be entered in the repository list manually.

These instructions may be subject to change as newer versions of the zip are uploaded after major changes.
