This is the package for the CobwebPackageManager. If this is your first time installing it or it is a fresh install, download the CobwebPackageManager.zip file and extract the contents(the folder named CobwebPackageManager) to .minecraft/mods/advancedMacros/macros. Do not take anything out of the folder. You should then be able to run minecraft, bind 'CobwebPackageManager/cobwebUI' to the "Chat" event, and type '!cpm install CobwebPackageManager' to get the latest version. After this is done, you can delete the "Chat" binding as the current version uses the "ChatSendFilter" event.

To list available packages, type '!cpm list'. Third party repositories are supported, though at current the url must be entered in the repository list manually.

These instructions may be subject to change as newer versions of the zip are uploaded after major changes.
