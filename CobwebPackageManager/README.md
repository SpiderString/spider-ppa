This is the package for the CobwebPackageManager. CPM is used to facilitate automatic installation, binding, and upgrading of Advanced Macros packages in-game from any properly set up Github repository.

Currently, there are two zips available. CobwebPackageManager.zip for AM 5.8.1 and CobwebPackageManager0.65_6.2.0.zip for AM 6.2.0. If you are running AM 5.x.x, use the first. If you are running CPM 6.x.x, use the second. It's recommended you update to AM 6.x.x as soon as possible, and CPM will not be developed further for versions below AM 6.

To install CPM, simply download the correct zip and place the folder contained within it in .minecraft/mods/advancedMacros/macros.
Then, bind CobwebPackageManager/cobwebUI to the "ChatSendFilter" event and type '!cpm upgrade' to grab the latest version for your AM installation.

To list available packages, type '!cpm list'. Third party repositories are supported, though at current the url must be entered in the repository list manually.

These instructions may be subject to change as newer versions of the zip are uploaded after major changes.
