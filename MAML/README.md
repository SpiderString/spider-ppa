This is an EXPERIMENTAL package for transpiling code from the [Macro/Keybind Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275039-macro-keybind-mod).
It still requires heavy development and its underlying structure is subject to change as the algorithm is finalized.

As always, helping by contributing to this package(or any of them on this PPA), is greatly encouraged and appreciated. Even if you have no experience coding, however, you can still help contribute to this project by donating scripts written in the Macro/Keybind Mod language for translation practice.
