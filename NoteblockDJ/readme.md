This package is under HEAVY development and still has a long way to go. However, you can go ahead and download it and play around with it if you choose.

In short, it allows for the registering of noteblock "instruments" (layouts of noteblocks) and using those instruments to playback
songs by coordinating your hands for you. Think of it kind of like a MIDI player, for noteblocks.
There's still a lot to be done with it, including getting the instruments to work properly no matter what configuration they're in.
At the moment, it by default supports noteblocks in flat configurations, i.e. you stand on top of them and play.
There may be lag on servers, and the default songs file comes with a simple version of the Tetris theme I transcribed.

Do be aware, at the moment the default songs file is simple listed as a package requirement, which means any update will redownload the songs file, potentially overwriting anything added in. For this reason, if you decide to make your own songs manually, it is a good idea to either change the songs file path or copy your songs file before updating.
